100 % of simulations were completed before time limit occurred
There were 1000 mission failures and 0 succcesses, after 1000 runs
This corresponds to a failure rate of 100 %
Across all simulations, there were a total of 17727 component failures
Failed in each phase the following number of times:    0     0  1000     0     0
